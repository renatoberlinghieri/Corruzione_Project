# Corruzione_Project
Here's the first try to use Git and we decided to try it on the part of the research related to corruption, particularly articles scraped from Factiva.
I suggest you to do the very short (10 mins) tutorial for Git which explains how to use master, branching and pulling requests. Once that everything will much more clear. 
As soon as I have a first try of code I will upload it here and you can modify it by branching as you prefer and suggest.
Hope this is something useful, 
Renato
